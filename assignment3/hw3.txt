Q1.
I ran the below time commands on a large folder (/usr) and the patched \ 
version appears to be faster. Removing the condition "if (ignore_mode \
 == IGNORE_DEFAULT)" allowed the patched version to save time.

before patch:
time ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a -A -R /usr
real    0m28.288s
user    0m1.864s
sys     0m5.519s

after patch:
time coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A -R /usr
real    0m19.894s
user    0m1.465s
sys     0m3.781s

Q2. The version of the patched version of coreutils (8.29) is ahead of the \
unpatched version installed in /usr/bin (8.22). This could cause compatibility \
issues and I would check existing integrations in a test environment before \
implementing the patch on the production environment.

Q3. the script generates an IndexError from the imported random.py library, \
as it does not support empty inputs.

Q4. the script generates a SyntaxError as python3 does not support the \
syntax "except IOError as (errno, strerror)".

Q5. it works as expected.
