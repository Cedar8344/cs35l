I connected the BeagleBone to my computer and turned it on. After installing \
the drivers I navigated to 192.168.7.2 on my browser. A web page popped up with \
set up instructions so I assumed that the device works properly.

I then ssh'ed into the devices using
$ ssh debian@192.168.7.2
and entered the default password when prompted.

I connected to wifi using
$ connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
    Scan completed for wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
    Agent registered
connmanctl> connect wifi_f045daf5ee73_55434c415f574542_managed_none
connmanctl> quit

To install I updated package lists using
$ sudo apt-get update
Then I installed xuath, openssh-server and openssh-client using the below:
$ sudo apt-get install xauth openssh-server openssh-client

I generated my rsa key pair using
$ ssh-keygen
    ...
    Your identification has been saved in /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:NZHL+TKNYw6WqSVBfG+QKV20RbMlh/H/QRq8lovd60o debian@beaglebone
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 2048]----+
    |     . . =+o*oo  |
    |      + * .+oB   |
    |     . o ++o.o.. |
    |      .  .*.  *. |
    |       .S+ + = ..|
    |      . * * * o o|
    |       = + = E ..|
    |      .   . .   .|
    |             .oo |
    +----[SHA256]-----+

To set up the server, I then created an user account for my partner (Omer Katz) \
and set a password using the below, and created an .ssh folder with proper permissions:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/omer -m omer
$ sudo passwd omer
$ cd /home/omer
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R omer .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then installed graphical packages (xterm, gedit, firefox) for my partner to test out:
$ sudo apt-get install xterm
$ sudo apt-get install gedit
$ sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

To check my IP address, I ran
$ ifconfig
    ...
    wlan0:
        inet 172.28.219.1
    ...
and found it under wlan0.

I gave the IP address to my partner and he was able to connect to my BeagleBone and \
run xterm, gedit and firefox.

We then switched roles and I was the client this time. I used the below to copy my \
public key to the server, add private key to ssh-agent, and ssh into his server:

$ ssh-copy-id -i jzeng@172.28.157.102
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
$ ssh-add
$ ssh -X jzeng@172.28.157.102

I was able to connect successfully and run commands.
