I set up a fresh copy of diffutils, copied patch file into the directory, then \
checked out version 3.0 into a new brance named "quote" as specified.

$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-hw
$ cp quote-3.0-patch.txt diffutils-hw/
$ cd diffutils-hw
$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112 -b quote
    M       src/cmp.c
    M       src/diff.c
    M       src/diff3.c
    M       src/dir.c
    M       src/sdiff.c
    M       src/util.c
    Switched to a new branch 'quote'

I then installed the patch using the previously generated patch file
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
    patching file src/cmp.c
    patching file src/diff.c
    patching file src/diff3.c
    patching file src/dir.c
    patching file src/sdiff.c
    patching file src/util.c

I created a ChangeLog of quote-3.0-patch.txt using emacs add-change-log-entry-\
other-window (C-x 4 a), then pasted in the original description as instructed.

I verified the changes using git status, then added and commited them with \
ChangeLog as the message.
$ git clean -f
$ git status
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

I then generated the formatted patch as described using git format patch:
$ git format-patch -1 HEAD --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Partner: Kuo-Hsuan (Shren) Tseng: 405356615

I created a new branch of v3.0 and applied my partner's patch as below:
$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112 -b partner
$ git am < formatted-patch-shren.txt
    Applying: 2019-11-17 Kuo-Hsuan Tseng <classkts@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

I compiled using the below commands then ran make check.
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Similar to the lab, make check generated errors that are the same as the ones \
I got during the lab. Per Piazza #440, I recorded the errors and verified using \
the newly compiled diff command instead.
$ make check
    ...
    make: *** [Makefile:1017: check-recursive] Error 1
$ make check SHELL='sh -x'
    ...
    make: *** [Makefile:1017: check-recursive] Error 1
$ src/diff . -
    src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory 
$ src/diff --help
    ...
    LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.
    ...

I then ran
$ make distdir

which generated a new folder named diffutils-3.0.1-903c. I inspected the \
ChangeLog and saw that my partner's name show up correctly.
$ less diffutils-3.0.1-903c/ChangeLog

I logged out of SEASnet and installed VcXsrv on my computer (Windows with WSL). \
I then reconnected to SEASnet with an -Y flag to enable trusted X11 forwarding.

$ ssh classjze@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu -Y
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk

I scrolled down to find the described commit and found the following:
