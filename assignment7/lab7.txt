I cloned diffutils as below and moved into the directory.
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git 
$ cd diffutils

I generated a copy of the log using git log:
$ git log > ../git-log.txt

I generated a list of tags using git tag:
$ git tag > ../git-tags.txt

I used grep to locate the desired commit. I then added a -B flag to show lines \
before the title. After trying different numbers, I found that -B 4 is just enough \
to show the commit hash.
$ grep "maint: quote" git-log.txt -B 4
    commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
    Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
    Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.
I then generated a patch using the below:
$ git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
    0001-maint-quote-like-this-or-like-this-not-like-this.patch
Renamed patch file according to spec:
$ mv 0001-maint-quote-like-this-or-like-this-not-like-this.patch quote-patch.txt

I then used a similar grep command as above to find the commit hash of version 3.0.
$ grep "version 3.0" git-log.txt -B 4
    commit 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112
    Author: Jim Meyering <meyering@redhat.com>
    Date:   Mon May 3 18:49:55 2010 +0200

        version 3.0
I checked out the commit using
$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112

I applied the patch using the patch command and recorded the errors:
$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

I then checked git status:

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

I inspected the git status output above and reverted all the non .c files. \
I used vc-revert (C-x v u) in emacs then confirmed by typing yes when prompted. \
These are the files I reverted:
    NEWS
    README
    TODO
    doc/diagmeet.note
    ms/config.bat
    ms/config.site
    po/en.po
    src/diff.h
    src/system.h
    tests/help-version

I then inspected the c files using vc-diff (C-x v =) and reverted hunks using \
diff-apply-hunk (C-c C-a)
    src/analyze.c - reverted using vc-revert 
    src/cmp.c - reverted quotes in comments using diff-apply-hunk
    src/context.c - reverted using vc-revert
    src/diff.c - reverted quotes in comments using diff-apply-hunk
    src/diff3.c - reverted quotes in comments using diff-apply-hunk
    src/dir.c - reverted quotes in comments
    src/ifdef.c - reverted using vc-revert
    src/io.c - reverted using vc-revert
    src/sdiff.c - reverted quotes in comments using diff-apply-hunk
    src/side.c - reverted using vc-revert
    src/util.c - reverted quotes in comments using diff-apply-hunk

I used ls to find the .c.rej files:
$ ls src/*.c.rej
    src/diff.c.rej  src/diff3.c.rej
I then copied the changes in the files manually to the original files.

I removed the untracked files using
$ git clean -f

I ran "git status" again to verify the changed files, and it indeed \
shows only half a dozen files.
$ git status
    ...
    modified:   src/cmp.c
    modified:   src/diff.c
    modified:   src/diff3.c
    modified:   src/dir.c
    modified:   src/sdiff.c
    modified:   src/util.c
    ...
I then ran git diff and exported the diff into a txt file as specified
$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

I verified the number of lines of the file using wc -l
$ cat quote-3.0-patch.txt | wc -l
    335

I first downloaded and applied the patch 
$ wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
$ patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff

I then ran the commands as specified in README-hacking.
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make

For the last step the command "make check" did not work for me. I also tried \
a modified command from Piazza but it also did not work. I moved on as instructed \
on Piazza.
$ make check
    ...
    make: *** [Makefile:1017: check-recursive] Error 1
$ make check SHELL='sh -x'
    ...
    make: *** [Makefile:1017: check-recursive] Error 1

diff seems to have compiled successfully despite the error from make check. \
I tried the compiled diff in the scenarios and it worked as expected
$ src/diff . -
    src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory 
$ src/diff --help
    ...
    LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.
    ...

I moved the source code of both the patched and unpatched versions into \
diffutils-3.0-patch/ and diffutils-3.0/ respectively. 

$ mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch
$ cp src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0-patch/

$ cd ..
$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-old
$ cd diffutils-old/
$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112

$ mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
$ cp src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0/

I then used the patched diff executable to compare the two folders as below
$ cd ..
$ diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt

I generated the diff between quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt using 
$ diff -u quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-test.txt > diffutils-patch.diff

I then inspected diffutils-patch.diff and noticed that all the changes are innocuous.
